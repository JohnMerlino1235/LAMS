# Getting Started with the LAMBS Front-End Repository

## Cloning the Repository

Open a new instance of terminal and navigate directory where you want to store the repository. Run the following:
### `git clone https://github.com/JohnMerlino1235/LAMS.git`

# Working on a new ticket

We will be assigning tickets for each new feature that we will develop. To work on an assigned ticket from our project found [here]https://lams-eece.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/LAM/boards/2, please do the following:

Switch to the main branch:
### `git checkout main`

Pull the most recent version of the main branch:
### `git pull -r origin main`

Create a new branch based on the ticket you are working on:
### `git checkout -b ${TICKET_NAME}`

For example, if I was working on the LAM-1 ticket, I would do the following:
### `git checkout -b LAM-1`

# Committing Code

Add all necessary files that should be committed:
### `git add .`

Commit the added files with a message corresponding to the ticket description:
### `git commit -m "${TICKET_DESCRIPTION}`

For example, if I was working on this[https://lams-eece.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/LAM/boards/2?modal=detail&selectedIssue=LAM-1] ticket I would add the following commit message:
### `git commit -m "[FE] - Login Page Implementation"`

Push the commit to your branch:
### `git push`

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
